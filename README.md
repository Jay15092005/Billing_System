Here's a summary of the code:



The provided code is a Python script that simulates a restaurant billing system called "La Fountain: The Food Fair". It starts with a welcome message from the manager and prompts the customer to enter their name, phone number, and email address. If the provided information is valid, it gets appended to a CSV file named "Name.csv" along with the current timestamp.

The script then displays a menu with various food and beverage items, each with an index number and price. The customer is prompted to enter the index number of the desired item(s). The selected items are added to a list along with their quantities and prices.

After the customer has finished selecting items, the script generates a bill that includes the selected items, their quantities, and prices. It also calculates the total cost, GST (18%), SGST (9%), and CGST (9%). The final bill, including taxes, is then printed with a thank you message.

The code demonstrates the use of various Python concepts such as data structures (lists), file handling (writing to a CSV file), conditional statements (if-elif-else), loops (while loop), user input validation, and string formatting.

The developer expresses pride in creating this restaurant billing system as a semester project without expert help, highlighting the achievement of building a system that would typically require payment on online platforms.
